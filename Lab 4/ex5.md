1.  The 'timeit.timeit()' function executes a statement a specified number of times ('number') and returns the total elapsed time. This approach is useful for quick measurements and when the operation being measured has a relatively consistent execution time. The 'timeit.repeat()' function is an extension of 'timeit.timeit()', allowing it to be executed multiple times ('repeat') with 'number' iterations each time. This can be useful for identifying variability in the measurements. The 'timeit.timeit()' function is appropriate when you're interested in the performance of a piece of code over many iterations and less concerned about variability between individual runs. The 'timeit.repeat()' function would be appropriate when you need to understand the variability in execution time to identify potential outliers.

2.  Since the 'timeit.timeit()' function provides a total time for all iterations, the most appropriate statistic would be the average time per execution, obtained by dividing the total time by the number of iterations. This gives a sense of the typical execution time for a piece of code. The 'timeit.repeat()' function gives multiple total times for the same number of executions. The minimum time statistic would be the most representative of the code's execution in an ideal environment as it is likely the closest to the true execution time of the code without interference. The average can still be useful to understand general performance, while the maximum can highlight the worst-case scenarios under heavy system load or other adverse conditions.

1. Arrays are fixed size compared to linked lists which are dynamically sized, therefore linked lists allow insertion, deletion and updates to its capacity such as the growth and shrink if the memory space is available
Arrays have indexes while linked lists do not, therefore arrays can be accessed if given certain index and linked lists have to be traveresed to find the element needed

2. This function can be implemented by first deletion then insertion. With this, it can minimize the impact of each standalone tasks because you dont have to do it manually

3. Insertion sort - feasbile to implement a doubly linked list because it can insert elements easily by traversing the doubly linked list through nodes then comparing the adjecent nodes from the front or back of the list.
Merge sort - feasbile to implement a doubly linked list because merge sort is a divide and conquer alghoritim, so it breaks down the list into smaller subsets

4. Time complexity should stay the same however space complexity between a doubly linked list and regular array is different based on how the techniques are implemented. In general, linked lists are non-contingous and arrays are contingous which affect the memory allocation.
